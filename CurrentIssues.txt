Bugs Dao is working on: //Jake: figured we should have some way to make sure we don't fix the same bug twice
commenting for general usage
fog of war implementation? //set as separate branch
Potential screen at start just to explain basics of the game?

Jake is working on:
Commenting/Confusing ordering of variables, needs readability
Enemy movement
When attacking adjacent enemies friendly units will move to another space where they can attack

Important Issues:
Unable to see what each building is worth in terms of income
Unintuitive as to how quickly units can take buildings  
^Results in being unable to move some of the spawned units and preventing the next turn from being possible
Can't move onto town and not capture


Victory Conditions?

Resolved by most recent commit:
Multiple units can be spawned in a row on one turn from a single spawn point, thus allowing unit stacking
attacking an enemy that has moved causes the unit to become attackable
move highlights & path are not cleared by enemy turn
spamming end turn button breaks game
