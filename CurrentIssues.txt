Bugs Dao is working on: //Jake: figured we should have some way to make sure we don't fix the same bug twice

Bugs Jake is working on:
Commenting/Confusing ordering of variables, needs readability

Important Issues:
Unable to see what each building is worth in terms of income
Unintuitive as to how quickly units can take buildings
Multiple units can be spawned in a row on one turn from a single spawn point, thus allowing unit stacking
^Results in being unable to move some of the spawned units and preventing the next turn from being possible
Enemy Knight can't be attacked //might be intentional due to the Knight being the piece that moves during enemy turns
^Leads to enemy knight stacking on your unit
Can capture then move
Can't move onto town and not capture


Victory Conditions?

Recently Resolved:
Unit stacking
Can't view unit cost
