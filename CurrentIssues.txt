Important Issues:
Commenting/Confusing ordering of variables, needs readability
Unable to see unit costs or what each building is worth in terms of income
Units can not stand still //No end turn early option
It is not possible for a unit to use some of its movement, then the rest //comment from Dao IMO move attack move should not be possible

Unintuitive as to how quickly units can take buildings
Attack and move should be separate commands so that players have the opportunity to place their units in better locations
Whichever unit the player moves last shows as having moved on day 2 even though it has moved day 1 (issue is purely visual, unit can still be moved)
Multiple units can be spawned in a row on one turn from a single spawn point, thus allowing unit stacking
^Results in being unable to move some of the spawned units and preventing the next turn from being possible

Unimportant Issues:
Jake uses the word "we" way to much in his comments
Jake writes way too many comments for way too little code

Recently Resolved:
Issue: If you attack with a unit, and put it on top of an old unit, they stack. Seems unintuitive to have units hidden under each other
Fix: It's no longer possible to move a unit on top of another by attacking
