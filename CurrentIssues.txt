Bugs Dao is working on: //Jake: figured we should have some way to make sure we don't fix the same bug twice
commenting for general usage
fog of war implementation? //set as separate branch
Potential screen at start just to explain basics of the game?

Jake is working on:
Loads with some squares not displayed, if you zoom out in browser and reload shows those squares
Commenting/Confusing ordering of variables, needs readability
Enemy movement
Enemy units move in order they are in array, regardless of if there is a better one
Enemy units can't attack
enemy units can move through friendly
plan destination is stupid simple
buildEnemyUnits broken af
no win/loss
unit moving off structure doesn't affect capture hp


Important Issues:
Unable to see what each building is worth in terms of income
Unintuitive as to how quickly units can take buildings  
^Results in being unable to move some of the spawned units and preventing the next turn from being possible
Can't move onto town and not capture


Victory Conditions?

Resolved by most recent commit:
When attacking adjacent enemies friendly units will move to another space where they can attack
