Bugs Dao is working on: //Jake: figured we should have some way to make sure we don't fix the same bug twice

Bugs Jake is working on:
Commenting/Confusing ordering of variables, needs readability
Unit stacking when attacking with top left soldier then bottom right

Important Issues:
Unable to see unit costs or what each building is worth in terms of income
Unintuitive as to how quickly units can take buildings
Multiple units can be spawned in a row on one turn from a single spawn point, thus allowing unit stacking
^Results in being unable to move some of the spawned units and preventing the next turn from being possible
Enemy Knight can't be attacked //might be intentional due to the Knight being the piece that moves during enemy turns
^Leads to enemy knight stacking on your unit

Victory Conditions?

Resolved:
Issue: Units can not stand still //No end turn early option
Fix: The turn now ends when you press space or enter

Issue: Can't produce a unit if you already moved all your units
Fix: Same as above

Issue: It is not possible for a unit to use some of its movement, then the rest 
Fix: unitMoved has been reworked so that now it represents how much movement a unit has left. It is only marked as moved if it attacks, or uses all its moves and is not within attack range of an enemy.

Issue: Attack and move should be separate commands so that players have the opportunity to place their units in bet
ter locations
Fix: Above changes make it so that you can attack the old way or move to a square then attack

Issue: Whichever unit the player moves last shows as having moved on day 2 even though it has moved day 1 (issue is purely visual, unit can still be moved)
Fix: Issue was caused by enemyTurn, which has been temporarily disabled, until rest of game is relatively non-buggy

Issue: If you capture an enemy structure then capture a neutral structure capture graphic stays red
Fix: Added an "else if" to the first "if" in captureStructure
