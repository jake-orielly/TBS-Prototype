Bugs Dao is working on: //Jake: figured we should have some way to make sure we don't fix the same bug twice

Bugs Jake is working on:
Commenting/Confusing ordering of variables, needs readability
Units can not stand still //No end turn early option
Can't produce a unit if you already moved all your units
It is not possible for a unit to use some of its movement, then the rest 

Important Issues:
Unable to see unit costs or what each building is worth in terms of income
Unintuitive as to how quickly units can take buildings
Attack and move should be separate commands so that players have the opportunity to place their units in better locations
Multiple units can be spawned in a row on one turn from a single spawn point, thus allowing unit stacking
^Results in being unable to move some of the spawned units and preventing the next turn from being possible
Enemy Knight can't be attacked //might be intentional due to the Knight being the piece that moves during enemy turns
^Leads to enemy knight stacking on your unit

Victory Conditions?

Unit stacking when attacking with top left soldier then bottom right

Resolved:
Issue: Whichever unit the player moves last shows as having moved on day 2 even though it has moved day 1 (issue is purely visual, unit can still be moved)
Fix: Issue was caused by enemyTurn, which has been temporarily disabled, until rest of game is relatively non-buggy

Issue: If you capture an enemy structure then capture a neutral structure capture graphic stays red
Fix: Added an "else if" to the first "if" in captureStructure
