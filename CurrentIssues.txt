Units can not stand still
It is not possible for a unit to use some of its movement, then the rest
Commenting/Confusing ordering of variables, needs readability
Unable to see unit costs or what each building is worth in terms of income

Recently Resolved:

Fix: It's no longer possible to move a unit on top of another by attacking
