Important Issues:
Commenting/Confusing ordering of variables, needs readability
Unable to see unit costs or what each building is worth in terms of income
Units can not stand still
It is not possible for a unit to use some of its movement, then the rest //comment from Dao IMO move attack move should not be possible

New Issues:
Units can attack multiple times in a row without ending their turn
Unintuitive as to how quickly units can take buildings

Unimportant Issues:
Jake uses the word "we" way to much in his comments
Jake writes way too many comments for way too little code

Recently Resolved:
Issue: If you attack with a unit, and put it on top of an old unit, they stack. Seems unintuitive to have units hidden under each other
Fix: It's no longer possible to move a unit on top of another by attacking
