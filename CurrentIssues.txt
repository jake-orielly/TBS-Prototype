Bugs Dao is working on: //Jake: figured we should have some way to make sure we don't fix the same bug twice
commenting for general usage
fog of war implementation? //set as separate branch
Potential screen at start just to explain basics of the game?

Jake is working on:
Commenting/Confusing ordering of variables, needs readability
Multiple units can be spawned in a row on one turn from a single spawn point, thus allowing unit stacking
Enemy movement
attacking an enemy that has moved causes the unit to become attackable
move highlights & path are not cleared by enemy turn

Important Issues:
Unable to see what each building is worth in terms of income
Unintuitive as to how quickly units can take buildings  
^Results in being unable to move some of the spawned units and preventing the next turn from being possible
Can't move onto town and not capture


Victory Conditions?

Resolved by most recent commit:
When enemies move entityLayer is not updated (easy fix but I have to go to work)
aka "Enemy Knight can't be attacked"
Enemy units can stack
Enemy units only move one space at a time
Can capture then move
